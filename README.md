# Roland

*Roland* is currently in prototype state. Most code will eventually change and
is currently almost unusable.  

*Roland* aims to be an alternative to InDesign and Tex alike.  
The main goal is to provide a convenient way for authors and designers to work
together on a document. Authors should find a convenient tool for writing while
designers should be able to shape PDF documents whith professionnal grade
quality.  

Nevertheless, *Roland* wish to keep in mind that if tools shape products, it
should allow users to extend it but also to experiment in its own construction.
